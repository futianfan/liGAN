## Dependencies

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-image
- torch
- openbabel
- rdkit
- [molgrid](https://github.com/gnina/libmolgrid)
- [gnina](https://github.com/gnina/gnina)

**NOTE**: Please be aware that the current version of molgrid provided through pip/conda is incompatible with conda openbabel, and you will likely get segmentation faults if you install them both through conda.

A molgrid conda build recipe is in the works (see https://github.com/mattragoza/conda-molgrid), but for now you can use [this environment](https://github.com/mattragoza/conda-molgrid/blob/master/environment.yaml) to build libmolgrid from source.

## Usage

### Generating molecules

To generate molecules, you must first download the pretrained model weights:

```
sh download_weights.sh
```

Then just run the `generate.py` script with the default configuration file:

```
python generate.py config/generate.config
```

### Training a model

To train a model from scratch, you must first download the full Crossdocked2020 data set:

```
sh download_data.sh
```

More info about this data set can be found [here](https://github.com/gnina/models/tree/master/data/CrossDocked2020).

Then you can run the `train.py` script with the default configuration file:

```
python train.py config/train.config
```
